# MemoryGlass

With more and more individuals suffering from amnesia or people just being really forgetful like myself, I wanted to engineer some device to help me recall names and information i have stored about an individual. Therefore introducing MemoryGlass, a simple yet effect way to be one of the most caring person. It allows you to discreetly recall every minute detail and any important information. Potential
enhancements include real-time translation and automatic conversation context updates.

Steps to try it out:
1. Acquire raspberry pi and camera
2. Deposit a photo of yourself into the friends/pics and information in the other folder
3. run python testing.py
4. See it work in action

Currently, designing a better pair of sunglasses to conceal the rpi.
Demo is in progress...
